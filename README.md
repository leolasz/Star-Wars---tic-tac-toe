# Tic-tac-toe-Star-Wars

project 0

Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as zeros and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper and pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces on a 3 × 3 grid. three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line wins the game. My idea was to create a thematic version of Star Wars with an opening page and another that directs to the game, tried through sounds and effects to bring that thought of battle star wars.
